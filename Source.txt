Coding was done on Python 3.5.1, so results may vary for Python 2.0

Python code for a given problem is saved as the ID of the problem on the site
i.e. The code for 'The 3n+1 problem' is found in '110101.py'

The code also runs based on input from a text, which is identified by the ID of the problem
